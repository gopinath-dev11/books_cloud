BOOKS CLOUD" is a web application designed to help users keep track of books they've read by noting down the title, author name, and a brief description. The app functions like a to-do list, allowing users to easily add, edit, and delete book entries. Built using HTML for structuring the interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions, it offers a simple, efficient way to manage book records and keep personal reading history organized.
# HTML
The HTML code includes a navigation bar, a section for displaying book entries with titles, authors, and descriptions, and a popup form for adding new books. The app uses external stylesheets for fonts and icons, and JavaScript handles the functionality of adding and deleting book records dynamically.

# CSS
The CSS code defines a clean, minimalistic layout with a brown and cream color scheme. The navbar has a solid background and padding for better spacing. Containers for books have a fixed width and display as inline blocks with rounded corners. Buttons are styled with consistent background colors and padding. Popup boxes for adding books are centered and have transparent inputs with customized placeholder text.

# Javascript
The JavaScript code controls the behavior of a popup form used to add book details. When the "Add" button is clicked, the popup appears, allowing the user to enter a book's title, author, and description. The entered information is displayed in a new container on the page. A "Delete" button allows users to remove a book entry from the list.
